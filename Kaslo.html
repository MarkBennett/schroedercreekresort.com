						while looking out over the shores of Kootenay Lake or to go on a stroll through town or along the beach</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Tour the local shops that Kaslo has to offer, view the works of local artists or, to learn more about the pioneering
						history of the area, hop aboard the S.S. Moyie, the oldest surviving sternwheeler vessel of its type, built in 1898</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Whether you want to grab a quick bite to eat, treat yourself to an ice cream or have a leisurely dinner at a fine restaurant,
						you don't have to go any further than Kaslo</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Kaslo is also the perfect place to stock up on amenities including, meat and groceries, fresh produce, organic foods,
						fresh clay-oven baked bread or drug store items</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Or, if you need something from the hardware store or to replace that magic hook because of "the one that got away",
						just head into Kaslo</li>
